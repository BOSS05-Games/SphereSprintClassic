# Sphere Sprint
The original Sphere Sprint, hosted on GitHub.

This is the first 3D game I ever made. It's far from perfect (which is why the sequel, Sphere Sprint 2, is currently in development), but it is still quite fun.

You can find the Windows version under Releases, but the web version (v1.9c) is here:

v1.9 is split into 3 forms, which are explained on their release pages.
