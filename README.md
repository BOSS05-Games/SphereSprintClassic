# Sphere Sprint
The original Sphere Sprint, hosted on GitHub.

This is the first 3D game I ever made. It's far from perfect (which is why the sequel, Sphere Sprint 2, is currently in development), but it is still quite fun.
Version 1.9 will be the final version, as I have to start working on Sphere Sprint 2, but I wanted to make a few changes.
