# Sphere Sprint
The original Sphere Sprint, hosted on GitHub.

This is the first 3D game I ever made. It's far from perfect (which is why the sequel, Sphere Sprint 2, is currently in development), but it is still quite fun.

You can find the Windows version under Releases, but the web version (v1.9c) is here:

I wanted to improve Sphere Sprint, but still have a version up like the original, so v1.9 is split into 3 types.


v1.9a - Original - Same game, better graphics, lesser performance

v1.9b - Lite - Same game, lesser graphics, better performance

v1.9c - Toon - Same game, cartoon graphics, better performance

(I promise I won't do this again for Sphere Sprint 2)
